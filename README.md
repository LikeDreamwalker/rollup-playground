# rollup-playground
A demo for building a playground in rollup project.
https://stories.ldwid.com/build-a-playground-in-your-rollup-project-26ecbaba70d3

# what's this for?
This project shows you a way to build a test project in your SDK project, and by some settings you can init all projects by one script.
I think it's better.

# getting started
`npm i`
`npm run start`
What you edit in testSDK will be automatically built into playground, and you will feel it in local web server.
Please enjoy!
